# Licensing and minimum CI

Project-authored code and documentation in this repository are covered by the
root [LICENSE](../LICENSE), including files without an individual source header.
[NOTICE](../NOTICE) identifies the project attribution. Existing third-party
notices remain authoritative for their respective material. Dependencies are
not relicensed or bundled by this change. Protocol names, external contracts,

## Minimum CI scope

The always-triggered **Minimum CI** job runs on pull requests, main pushes,
merge groups, and manual dispatch. It checks tracked Python/JSON syntax, local
documentation links, and 7 or more offline regression tests. A missing,
reduced, failed, or skipped selected suite fails the job. Existing specialized
workflows remain in place.

This is a baseline, not full test coverage, a secret scan, or a production
readiness claim. The selected suite validates policy loading and context integrity. Editorial tool integration needs its separately installed dependencies and existing workflow.
Adding this workflow does not configure required branch checks or change bypass
permissions. Administrators must select its check separately if enforcement is
wanted. No runtime or service configuration is changed.
